# Nobel Prize Insights: Analyzing Trends in Laureates Over Time

## Project Overview
This project explores historical trends in Nobel Prize winners, focusing on key metrics like gender, birth country, and the presence of repeat laureates. By analyzing the Nobel Prize data, we uncover insights such as the dominance of certain birth countries, the proportion of female winners, and the most frequent Nobel Prize categories. Additionally, we identify notable figures in Nobel history, such as the first female laureate and repeat winners.
